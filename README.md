FastPelagaletto

A C++ library to play pelagaletto

Not so much code readability but high speed.. 1,000,000,000 matches in almost 30 minutes (in worst cases)

I use this library to play all the matches (now I play ~700,000,000,000/200,000,000,000,000)and the first infinite match that I found is:

PLAYER1 : 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 3 0 3 0 0

PLAYER2 : 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 1 2 0 3 0 2 0 3 1 0 0 1 0

Next goal play all the 200,000,000,000,000 and try to find an infinite match in Beggar-my-neighbour
